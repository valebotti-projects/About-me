# Hi! I'm Valentina, nice to meet you!

Here’s some information about me that might be interesting:
- I graduated in Computer Science in October 2025.  
- I studied *Informatica per la comunicazione digitale* at the Università degli Studi di Milano.  
- I’m currently based in Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna.  

My high school diploma is from *Liceo Artistico* (an art school). That was my starting point. At 19, my indecisive younger self realized that I loved designing products, and that became my goal. But, being the kind of adolescent who lived by “never let them know your next move,” I chose Computer Science to keep on with this idea. Not surprisingly, I discovered that I was learning much more than just how to create software — and that’s when I truly started to grow as an adult.
